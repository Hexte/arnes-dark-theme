A dark theme for the FRI moodle online classroom based on the popular Monokai colour scheme with further customization possible. Requires the Stylus web browser extension. There is no need to manually update the theme as auto-updating is on by default. Icon replacement now isn't guaranteed to work all the time, but this will be fixed in upcoming updates.

##  :gear: Installation

Install [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) for either [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Chrome & other chromium based browsers](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus-beta/apmmpaebfobifelkijhaljbmpcgbjbdo), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/stylus/) or [Cascadea for Safari](https://cascadea.app/).

After the plugin is installed:

##  :question: Changing the accent colours
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janvasiljevic/fri-dark-theme/master/images/accent-colour-instr.png" align="left"  style=" width: 100px;" /> 
<p> You can easily change the accent colours or icons by clicking the gear icon next to the style in the Stylus context menu. The colours should update in real time when changing them, but if they don't, re-enable the style and the changes should take place. Icons sometimes require multiple resets, as the browser caches them. </p>
